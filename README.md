EveryAir‚Äù on Smart Air-Quality Prediction System: Forecasting Pollution Level. In this Python based assignment libraries like panda, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, numpy, folium are used to analyse provided data in Asia_Dataset.csv, as well as forecasting future PM2.5 Air Pollution data to help with air pollution prediction in numbers of Asian countries(2000+ in dataset).

Data Preprocessing: Load data, handle missing values and insert current date. Extract viable data from the data.
Import Coordinates: Insert LATs and LONs of the specified cities, and predict the PM2.5 air pollution level accordingly.
Numerical Analysis: Month mapping, converting month strings into numerical values. Analyze PM2.5 trends and build an air pollution prediction model using Random Forest Regressor on Historical data and Real-time data.
Data Visualisation: Plotting air pollution trends and display real-time gauge meter for PM2.5 data for the relevant cities. Geospatial mapping visualisation for predicted and real-time PM2.5 level in the city.
